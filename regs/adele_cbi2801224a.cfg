# - All fields must be defined and honor the field type
# - 'scale' is used by modio to calculate the register value when -v <dnum> switch is used
# - 'type' is used by modio to select register access type without -t <type> switch
# - 'print' is used by modio to print register as binary (BIN), hex (HEX), decimal (DEC), ASCII (ASC),
